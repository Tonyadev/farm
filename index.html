    <p>The USDA’s Agriculture Research Service (ARS) just accomplished an important first against one of the world’s
        deadliest swine diseases.
        ARS scientists developed a vaccine for African swine fever (ASF) that protects hogs from the ASF strain found in
        Europe and Asia. </p>
    <p>When it comes to our pigs, we spend a lot of time and investment researching the best housing practices for their
        different stages of growth.
        We know that a well-cared for pig is a productive pig.
        Our farming is also the most emission friendly animal protein source today.</p>
